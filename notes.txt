REFACTORING
___________

Needs tests!
Tons of junk comments
Need to take out all inline styles 
Text should be in p tags
Too many divs
Controllers have wayyyy too much logic
views have wayy too much fucking logic
All point calculating related methods should be put in a module
variables should all be using snake case
somemethods in controllers need to be moved to private, ex: comments#savenormal
lots of unused models/files
scss files are an unorganized mess
javascript files are unorganized as well, a bunch of files should be in the vendor folder
why is sort! being used over order?
models that don't have their images uploaded by end users don't need attatched files
assignment category icon logic shouldn't be in the view, make it into a model method
