Figure out a way to get in contact with a mentor in your industry. Keep messaging/calling different people or keep following up with the same people until you get a meeting or call with them.
	Description:: Sometimes the only way to get to where you need to be is through sheer persistence. Many startup successes came to be because their founders would not take no for an answer. Getting yourself in front of a prominent figure when you don’t have much credit starting out can be difficult, but is absolutely necessary to grow and learn. Figure out a way to get in contact with a mentor in your industry. Keep messaging/calling different people or keep following up with the same people until you get a meeting or call with them.

	Body:: How can you brand your company to be very attractive to your target market, but still appealing to secondary markets? You don’t want to gain customers at the expense of alienating many potential customers in another demographic. For example, Reddit has issues with this. Their target market of young adult males comprises almost all of their users: 78% of users are males and 85% of them are between 18-34 years old. On the other hand, Facebook has quite a varied reach. They started out with a target market of college students but still have a massive adoption among baby boomers.
