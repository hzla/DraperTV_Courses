Failure is only good if we learn from it. Think about two times you failed spectacularly- one time when something good came out of it and one time when it just sucked and you had to overcome it and move on. Can you discern a key difference in the two times? What did you do differently afterwards? 
Sometimes we can even optimize failure. How can you “rig” your next spectacular failure to work out in the end? In other words, how can you engineer a silver lining for a risky moonshot idea?

Type: Challenge 
The act of starting a business itself breeds great ideas. Start up a business you are unfamiliar with for just a week - such as a lemonade stand, reselling old items on ebay for a profit, or anything else. Did you turn a profit? Why or why not? What did you learn?
Ideas actually start with problem seeking. List 5 interesting markets and document their problems and potential solutions.
Think about 3 of the most annoying problems in your life and come up with easy solutions that most people will be able to replicate.
Good ideas come from finding solutions to real problems, rather than creating a product and finding a market for it. Go out and ask 5 strangers what their biggest problems are, come up with solutions for them on the spot and note their reactions.
Stressing out on what to name your company? Take the 3-Column Chain Reaction approach. Get together your friends or cofounders  and have each person make 3 columns their own piece of paper. Also have 3 large columns drawn on a whiteboard or large piece of paper next to your group.
<tab>Give everyone 45 seconds to write down any crazy names they have in the first column on their paper. Don’t edit for good names, go for quantity.
<tab>Have everyone pick the top 3 names from their 1st column and put them in the first column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Give everyone 45 seconds to write down names in the 2nd column on their paper that they thought of by seeing the top picks of everyone from the 1st column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Have everyone pick top 3 names from their 2nd column and put them in the 2nd column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Give everyone 45 seconds to write down names in the 3rd column on their paper that they thought of by seeing the top picks of everyone from the 2nd column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Have everyone pick the top 3 names from their 3rd column and put them in the 3rd column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Pick your name from this 3rd column on the whiteboard. Now that you’ve been inspired by everyone’s best contributions and filtered them 3 times, these will be your best ideas!
Stressed that you haven’t come up with a good idea to work on yet? You can also use the 3 Column Chain Reaction approach for startup ideas too. Get together your friends or cofounders and identify 3 industries you would all be happy starting a company in, such as transportation, currency, education, etc. Make 3 sets of 3 large columns on a whiteboard, and have each person make 3 columns on their own piece of paper for each industry. For each industry:
<tab>Give everyone 45 seconds to write down any industry associations, products, or services they think of in the first column on their paper. If they already have idea tell them to write that on the side and save it for later. Don’t edit for quality, go for quantity here. An example could be the words bus, taxi, google maps, pedestrian, or traffic for transportation.
<tab>Have everyone pick top 3 entries from their 1st column and put them in the first column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Give everyone 45 seconds to write down user experiences or feelings in the 2nd column on their paper that they thought of by seeing the top picks of everyone from the 1st column on the whiteboard. An example would be “inefficient” for bus, or “walk through unsafe neighborhoods” for google maps and pedestrian.
<tab>Have everyone pick top 3 entries from their 2nd column and put them in the 2nd column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Give everyone 45 seconds to write down actual ideas or problems to solve in the 3rd column on their paper that they thought of by seeing the top picks of everyone from the 2nd column on the whiteboard. An example could be “crowdsource reporting of dangerous metropolitan areas and build alternate routes around flagged areas” for the walk through unsafe areas experience. Or “make a better bus scheduling/mapping app” for the inefficient bus problem.
<tab>Have everyone pick the top 3 ideas or problems to solve from their 3rd column and put them in the 3rd column on the whiteboard.
<tab>Pick your favorite idea to work on in this industry from this 3rd column on the whiteboard. Now that you’ve been inspired by everyone’s best contributions and filtered them 3 times these will be your best ideas! Repeat for the other two industries you would like to work in. Then do some more market research on each of the top one or two ideas from each industry to decide which one to pursue!

Explaining your startup with a comparison to other startups is a good way to avoid duplicating someone else’s idea and to quickly convey what you do.

For those you convinced, how did you do it?

You’re going to work and live around your founder almost 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so it’s incredibly important to not only work well with them but be okay with living with them. Grab a friend to work on a personal project and live with them for 4 days. You must be together at all times: eat meals together, sleep in the same room, work in the same room or same desk, and do the same activities when you’re on break.
Sometimes you can get the best leads online. Post to craigslist, angellist, or a silicon valley facebook group looking for a cofounder. Explain your idea and let people know what skills you need as a start.

<tab>Is your product a service? Invite 3 users for a “mock beta test”- Have them tell you what they want, then fulfill that service of your own accord without them knowing, and get their feedback on their experience. Ex. If you are a food delivery service, deliver the food yourself instead of putting in the work to hire a team of delivery people.

Do you think startups that provide solutions for other startups and small businesses (such as SquareSpace) have their own form of branding too? Does this change how you will brand your own company?
How can you brand your company to be very attractive to your target market, but still appealing to secondary markets? You don’t want to gain customers at the expense of alienating many potential customers in another demographic. For example, Reddit has issues with this. Their target market of young adult males comprises almost all of their users: 78% of users are males and 85% of them are between 18-34 years old. On the other hand, Facebook has quite a varied reach. They started out with a target market of college students but still have a massive adoption among baby boomers.
What is a story that moved you to take action recently, such as donating, buying, sharing on social media, or replying? What was so compelling about it?

Create Demand and Sell the Product Yourself
Scott Cook & Tom Proulx, Founders of Intuit
Scott and Tom talk about how big banks fail to sell Intuit’s software well, so they take matters into their own hands.
Type: Challenge 
In order to sell your product you’ll also need to be able to sell yourself! Cold call 5 businesses and try to sell them your skills. Doesn’t matter if you code, design, sell, strategize, or are just really good with people. Follow through with at least 1 gig.
Selling to strangers is much harder than to your friends! Create something such as a toy, food, artwork, music, or film and make $50 selling it. Don’t use anything you’ve made before, and don’t sell to friends or family. Record video or transcribe the process of you selling if you’d like feedback!
Create a sales pitch for your product, then deliver to 10 different people each time in a different style. For example, you can talk about it’s luxury value, its features, how pretty it looks, how easy it is to use, or how much money/time it can save. You can be aggressive, easy going, friendly, pushy, loud, or calm, just be sure to pitch differently each time. Which method worked best for your product? How did your body language and tone of voice change for each?
If you can sell a taboo product then you can definitely sell a standard one! Buy a sex toy and practice selling it to at least 10 people, and use a different opening line each time. 
Make an appointment with a personal shopper in a high end store like J. Crew, Saks, or Nordstrom. Take note of how the shopper opens the sale, assesses your needs, and then closes. Now make an appointment to test drive a vehicle with a car salesman. How is their approach different? Which do you prefer?
Trade an item you own up 3 times, what did you start with, and what did you end up with? How high of a value can you get yourself to? For instance, you could start with a pencil, trade it for a book, trade that for a cooking pan, and then trade that for a new chair!

Create a rigorous 20 day diet and get your friends to follow it to get in better shape. Think of incentives you can give them to keep them motivated and on track. Monitor your friends throughout the diet and every time someone drops off, ask them why they quit in an exit interview. What could you have offered them or done differently to keep them in it?
Type: Discussion
Think of your “target market” for your product. Do they seem like a “normal” person? Now think of a super intense power user who would use your product 10x a day or more. Who would this person be and what would they be like? For example, exosuits are being developed now for the military, but were originally thought out for a more mild user like the elderly for body support.
Think of all the ways companies you subscribe to try to retain you: emails, special sales, coupon codes, party invitations. Which offers move you to click to their site the most often? Is it usually in the form of a product savings opportunity or them personally connecting with you, such as by offering advice, or a heartfelt thank you message/letter?
What sort of sales tactics make you walk out the door or unsubscribe from a service? Why?

Take your favorite children’s story and distill it into a 2 minute pitch on how it has affected you so strongly and why you think other children should or shouldn’t read it.
It can be easy to lose your nerve asking investors for such huge sums of money as an investment. Go out, pitch 5 strangers and ask for 5 dollars as fundraising for your idea.
There are slightly different pitches that you give to different audiences to evoke certain reactions. Create 3 different pitches: one for an investor, one for a customer, and one for a cofounder. Go out and pitch the right people the right pitch. Then go out and pitch customers a cofounder pitch, investors a customer pitch, and cofounders and investor pitch. How did they react?

Investors Don't Fund Dots
Jeff Seibert, Founder of Crashlytics & Sr. Director of Product at Twitter
Jeff talks about how it’s important to constantly have meetings with investors while you are fundraising. Following up keeps investors updated on your progress and builds your image in their eyes. Instead of being seen as just a “dot” with a single meeting, multiple meetings contribute into building you up into a “curve”. He also remarks that it is often more important to have a relationship with a venture partner rather than the firm itself.
Type: Challenge 
Go to a meetup and get 10 business cards, then connect with them on Linkedin and set up 5 in-person meetings.
Networking needs to be genuine and not just for the sake of networking. Make friends with someone new today who you intend to meet again. Tell us about them.
Pick someone high profile that you admire and find a way to get in contact with them. Meet with them and learn about how they developed into the person that you look up to today.
Networking is not about you telling people your story, it’s about you listening to others. Learn the life stories of 10 strangers.
