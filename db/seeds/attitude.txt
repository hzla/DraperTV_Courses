Failure is only good if we learn from it. Think about two times you failed spectacularly: one time when something good came out of it and one time when it just sucked and you had to overcome it and move on. Can you discern a key difference in the two times? What did you do differently afterwards? 
Sometimes we can even optimize failure. How can you “rig” your next spectacular failure to work out in the end? In other words, how can you engineer a silver lining for a risky moonshot idea?
Apply one thing you learned from Joon Yun’s talk to imagine the future of your own industry. If you aim for 10X return, how will you go about bringing these changes?

Running a company is a marathon, not a sprint. You can’t work on a startup if you don’t eat well, sleep well, and exercise to stay healthy. You don’t have to give up meat to be healthy, but making such a drastic change takes a lot of willpower and discipline: become a vegetarian for 2 weeks and . If you cheat, that’s on you; there are much harder things you’ll have to face on your way to becoming an entrepreneur.
The hacking life style has been highly glamorized, but it’s actually a terrible idea to skip meals and go to bed at 5 AM every day. For 2 weeks, go to bed no later than 11 pm, wake up at 6 am, and get an hour of work done before 8 am. Again, cheat if you’d like, but remember that there are a lot of people out there who life like this already with no problems.
Sometimes the only way to get to where you need to be is through sheer persistence. Many startup successes came to be because their founders would not take no for an answer. Getting yourself in front of a prominent figure when you don’t have much credit starting out can be difficult, but is absolutely necessary to grow and learn. Figure out a way to get in contact with a mentor in your industry. Keep messaging/calling different people or keep following up with the same people until you get a meeting or call with them.

Think back to a time when you gave up instead of pushing forward. Why did you stop? Was worth it? If you could go back to do it all over again, could you make it?
Being a full time entrepreneur usually means giving up your social life, relationships, and family time for your work. You have to put everything you have into it because competition is fierce and everyone else is working just as hard if not not harder. How badly do you want to pursue your idea, and how much are you willing to sacrifice to reach your goals?
Think of a time when you did manage to push through instead of giving up. What kept you going? Could you dedicate yourself to pursuing a goal for 5 years, or even 10? What keeps you going through tough times even now?

Good leaders need to be able to reduce complex and complicated ideas down to simple explanations that people can understand. Learn about a scientific theory and explain it to us like you would to a 5 year old.
Many think leadership is about making decisions and convincing others to follow you. Practice “servant leadership” (http://bit.ly/1f9qDIM)  by serving others on your team or community- volunteer at an event, donate something useful to a homeless person besides money, get a stranger to tell you their life story, or ask the intern/secretary at your day job if you can help them out with some of their tasks. You’ll be surprised what you learn by leading from behind.
Knowing yourself helps with determining your strengths, weaknesses, and compatibility with other people. Being a leader means improving your flaws and harnessing your abilities. Take this test: http://www.16personalities.com/ to figure out roughly what your mental tendencies are. Share your results below and tell us about how you will make changes to how you work with other people.
Being a good leader means more than showing your followers where to go, but also helping those who may not have the ability to keep up. Do something a friend is afraid of, then help walk them through it together.
Leaders need to be good at figuring out other people’s strengths and what benefit they can provide. Find 5 strangers and learn something from each of them that you can use to better yourself.
